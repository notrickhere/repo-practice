	<h3 class="section fontStyle">Volleyball</h3>
	<p class="description fontStyle">I started playing volleyball as early as 8th grade. It all started when I was passing the ball around with my uncle at Millenium Park. The upcoming school year I tried out for the HighScool Team and by the end of the season I got picked up on the varsity team. Over the course of High School I broke the record for assists and kept breaking my own record every year. When undergrad rolled around I decided to focus more in school rather than to pursue volleyball at the collegiate level. Year round I participate in local tournaments hosted by the Yankee association. During the summers I would participate in a chinese version of volleyball called 9man Volleyball.</p>

<h3 class="section fontStyle">Bodybuilding</h3>

<div class="container">
	<p class="description fontStyle">At the ripe age of 15 I decided that I wanted to look a certain way. I was influenced by the bodybuilders on the Youtube at the time. I could'nt maximize my gains in highschool due to the fact I did not take food and sleep seriously. Eversince then I've been going to the gym atleast 4 times a week or else I would feel very lethargic.</p>

	<p class="description fontStyle">The GameCube was the first device that led me spiraling in to the world of video games. My favorite games to play now would be League of Legends and Call of Duty Modern Warfare.</p>
